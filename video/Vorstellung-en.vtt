1
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
My name is Christian Flury.

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
I am living in Wangen near Dübendorf

2a
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.500
in the surroundings of Zürich in Switzerland.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.500
What you see in front is the airfield of Dübendorf

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.500
which originally used to be Zurich's airport

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but eventually was used for military purposes only. 

6
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.000
Not so long ago the airforce stopped using it, too.  

7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.500
Now the airfield is serving several purposes

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but it's still uncertain what's to be done with it in the future. 

9
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.000
In the foreground - very small - are a couple of private jets  

10
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:05.000
belonging to attendees of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.

11
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.000
They are being parked here on the military airfield 

12
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.000
and usually the passengers continue their trip to Davos by helicopter.

13
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The temperature of 6 degrees Celsius at 2:30 in the afternoon

14
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.500
is unusually high for the season being. 

16
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There used to be many more private jets

16a
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
but today is the WEF's last day

17
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.500
and quite some people have departed already. 

18
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This is the view on the village of Wangen

19
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.000
having preserved a beautiful old village center

20
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.000
with farm houses and a village square.

21
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.500
In this direction is the city of Zurich.

22
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.500
It is attractive to live in this place 

23
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.500
because here is the transition from city to the countryside.

24
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now we are looking towards the city

24a
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.500
there is almost an urban character

25
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.500
whilst in the opposite direction - not visible from here 

26
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
there are meadows, forests and fields - truely the countryside.
